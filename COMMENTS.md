### Project Setup

I do not have php installed on my system, I always use dockerized php in my projects. This way I can avoid conflicts
between different projects and I can easily switch between different php versions. I started with adding a php 8.1 image
to the project.

Seems like the project requires php 8.2 instead of the 8.1 mentioned in the README.md file.
This is composer's output when trying to install the dependencies with php 8.1:
```
Your lock file does not contain a compatible set of packages. Please run composer update.

  Problem 1
    - symfony/css-selector is locked to version v7.0.3 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - symfony/css-selector v7.0.3 requires php >=8.2 -> your php version (8.1.28) does not satisfy that requirement.
  Problem 2
    - symfony/event-dispatcher is locked to version v7.0.3 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - symfony/event-dispatcher v7.0.3 requires php >=8.2 -> your php version (8.1.28) does not satisfy that requirement.
  Problem 3
    - symfony/string is locked to version v7.0.4 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - symfony/string v7.0.4 requires php >=8.2 -> your php version (8.1.28) does not satisfy that requirement.
  Problem 4
    - symfony/yaml is locked to version v7.0.3 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - symfony/yaml v7.0.3 requires php >=8.2 -> your php version (8.1.28) does not satisfy that requirement.
  Problem 5
    - symfony/string v7.0.4 requires php >=8.2 -> your php version (8.1.28) does not satisfy that requirement.
    - symfony/console v6.4.6 requires symfony/string ^5.4|^6.0|^7.0 -> satisfiable by symfony/string[v7.0.4].
    - symfony/console is locked to version v6.4.6 and an update of this package was not requested.
```
Well, I didn't want to downgrade the symfony packages (not looking forward for unforseeable consequences), so I switched
to php 8.2 and it secceeded. Immidiate return on my "not having specific php version installed" investment :).

```shell
vendor/bin/sail up -d

```

I removed the volume named `gig-interview_sail-mysql`, then ran sail up again. Seems like everything is working now.

---

```shell
vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
```
Indeed, there is an error:

```SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] Connection refused```

Unable to connect to the database with an IDE like DataGrip as well. I've added the `FORWARD_DB_PORT` .env entry with a
modified port, different from the default 3306, now at lease I can connect with my IDE, and I see the empty DB.

The interesting thing is, that sail can open a connection with compose, but not with artisan. 
So this
```shell
vendor/bin/sail mysql
```
gives me a live prompt, but `vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate` still gives me the same error.

Sometime later, I found out that I have to remove the existing volumes again, and recreate them with the following command:
```shell
vendor/bin/sail down -v && vendor/bin/sail up -d
```
After a fresh start, migration was successful. Finally!

### Usage Notes

Redis populator can be run with the following command:
```shell
vendor/bin/sail artisan app:redis:populate
```
It will create Sorted Sets for the Games and Casinos, as required. My chosen redis keys:
- casinos-global : no market filtering, sorted by rank
- casinos-[MARKET] : where [MARKET] is the value of the current market sorting group
- games-global : no market filtering, sorted by number of plays
- games-[MARKET] : where [MARKET] is the value of the current market sorting group

#### Manually check if the command succeeded

```shell
vendor/bin/sail redis

[select 0] # is optional, default db is 0 used by the laravel app

keys * # shows all the available created keys for games, casinos in every market and their global versions
keys *games* # show game keys only
keys *casinos* # show casino keys only

zrevragne laravel_database_casinos-global 0 -1 # show the global casino ranking
zrevrange laravel_database_games-[MARKET] 0 -1 # show the games ranking for the chosen market
```
I've decided not to do any sorting in code, because Redis handles it well. I use the models `rank` or `numberOfPlays` 
fields as the ranking index in the sorted sets. This way we will get ascending lists by default, but that is no problem,
`zrevrange` reads them back backwards, so we get a descending list.
